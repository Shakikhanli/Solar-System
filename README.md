# Solar-System

I have created this as a project work for Advanced graphical algorithms course. 

Project is very simple it. To run it you will just need to open project in WebStorm and choose browser. 
It will show you the 9 planets (if you consider Pluto as a planet ;) ) turning around the Sun. 

It is not a professional work and there are no copyrights for it so feel free if you want to use it :). 
If you have any additional questions about project or if you want to use it write my email. shekikhanli@gmail.com
